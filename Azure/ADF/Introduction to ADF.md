# üî∑ What is Azure Data Factory (ADF)?
Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to **create**, **schedule**, and **orchestrate** data pipelines to **move** and **transform** *data* from various sources to destinations.

**Real-life Analogy:**
Imagine you work in a logistics company. You have to:

- Pick items from different suppliers (data sources),

- Pack or modify them (data transformation),

- Deliver them to customers (destination systems).
*
***ADF is the logistics manager of your data world.***

### ‚úÖ Why is Azure Data Factory used?
**ADF is used for:**
- Data movement (copy data from source to destination),

- Data transformation (clean, reshape, enrich),

- ETL / ELT processes,

- Orchestration of complex workflows,

- Integrating cloud & on-premises data (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle, Azure Blob, REST APIs).

### ‚ùì Why do we need to learn ADF?
**As a Data Engineer:**
- You are expected to build and manage data pipelines.

- Most companies are shifting to cloud-based data platforms.

- ADF is a top skill in the Azure ecosystem and widely used in enterprise data engineering.

### üß† Core Concepts to Learn in ADF 
| **Concept** |	**What it Does** |
|-------------|------------------|
| Pipeline |	A group of activities (like steps in a recipe).|
| Activity |	Individual task (copy, transformation, execution).|
| Dataset |	Metadata pointing to data (like a file or table).
| Linked Service |	Connection string to a data source or sink.|
|Trigger |	Tells when to run the pipeline (on schedule, event, etc).|
|Integration Runtime|	The engine that runs the activities (self-hosted or Azure-hosted).|
