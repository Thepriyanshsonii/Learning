# 🧠 The Difference Between response.json() vs json.loads(response.text)

## **`✅ response.json()`**
- 🔍 Comes built-in with the requests library.

- 💡 It automatically parses the response as JSON and gives  you a Python dictionary/list.

- 📦 Internally, it does: json.loads(response.text) — but safely.

- ✅ Best for: Simple, clean, safe parsing of JSON from APIs.

```
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
data = response.json()  # returns Python dict/list
```
### ❌ `json.loads(response)` ❌ WRONG
- You should NOT do this. response is a Response object, not a string.

- You must use response.text instead (the actual content of the response).

## **`✅ json.loads(response.text)`**
- This is the manual way to parse JSON from raw response content.

- It works the same as response.json() but gives you more control (e.g., custom error handling).

- You must ensure the content is really JSON, or it will throw an error.
```
import json
data = json.loads(response.text)
```
## 🧪 Return Type Difference
| Method |	Returns	| Source Data |
|------------|--------|-----------|
|***response.json()***|	Python dict or list |	JSON content from API |
|***json.loads(response.text)*** |	Python dict or list |	Manually parsed JSON string |
|***json.loads(response)*** |	❌ Error |	Because response is not a string |

**✅ Best Practice?**
Use `response.json()` whenever possible — it’s cleaner, safer, and built for exactly this purpose.
