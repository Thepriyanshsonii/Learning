# 📘 Delta Lake - The Backbone of Reliable Data Lakes in Databricks
## 🔍 What is Delta Lake?
Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that adds ACID transactions, versioning, and schema enforcement to data lakes like Apache Spark + Parquet.

## 🆚 Data Lake vs Delta Lake

|**Feature** |	**Data Lake (Parquet, etc.)** | **Delta Lake** |
|------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| ***File Format***|	Parquet, CSV, JSON, etc. |	Delta (based on Parquet) |
|***ACID Transactions*** |	❌ No |	✅ Yes |
|***Schema Enforcement***|	❌ No (bad data can be written) |	✅ Yes |
|***Time Travel (versioning)***|	❌ No |	✅ Yes |
|***Concurrent Reads/Writes***|	❌ Risk of corruption |	 ✅ Handled safely |
|***Upserts & Deletes (MERGE)***|	❌ Complex |	✅ Built-in support |
|***Performance***|	🚫 Can be slow (no indexing)	|  ⚡ Optimized with indexing + caching |
|***Reliability***|	😬 Low (no atomicity) |	🛡️ High (ACID-compliant) |

## 🧠 Why Do We Need Delta Lake?
- To solve real-world problems that come with traditional data lakes:

    1. ❌ Data corruption due to partial writes

    2. ❌ Duplicate or inconsistent data

    3. ❌ Hard to update or delete old records

    4. ❌ No control over schema evolution

    5. ❌ Difficult to track data changes

✅ Delta Lake fixes all this!
